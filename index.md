# Finding the Lewis ‚ÄúDoughnut‚Äù

### For people who want to explore different ideas for influencing our community plans and our use of the environment, in and around the Isle of Lewis and on the islands beyond.

Hi, I‚Äôm Julia. I moved to Great Bernera in 2019 from Birmingham with my husband and have a croft in Kirkibost, where we plan to build a house and continue crofting into our older age. 

I‚Äôm interested in how to expand regenerative, economic and social opportunities on Lewis and the islands whilst acknowledging the cultural heritage of the place, crofting and traditional industries, and keeping within the planetary boundaries and protecting the amazing biosphere that we are stewards of.

A group of individuals from around the UK and beyond are hosting **peer-to-peer learning journeys** all about something called **neighbourhood doughnut economics**. 

Doughnut Economics is a really simple idea that says we should be able to **meet the needs of all people** (like everyone having enough to eat, a place to live and good health), **within the means of the planet** (so achieving that without exploiting our planet and its resources).

Neighbourhood doughnut economics is all about thinking, how we can apply that to our homes, our streets and our neighbourhood? What changes can we make happen to see new and better things, for our community and our local environment?

We've been given an amazing (free) ****opportunity to learn about and experiment with some of these questions, and **we're inviting people who live, work and play in our neighbourhood to join us**. 

Interested in taking part? Keep reading below!

- **Okay, rewind...** **Doughnut economics? What is that??** üç©
    
    We should be able to **meet the needs of all people**, **within the means of the planet**, right? Surely everyone should be able to have access to the things they need to live a good life, without polluting our oceans, or emitting a million tonnes of carbon, right? 
    
    Doughnut Economics is all about rethinking how we live, and rewriting the rules so we can live a more fairly and sustainably. And when you draw it all out, it just so happens you can draw it in the shape of a doughnut / bagel /  vada / other culturally appropriate ring-shaped foods. 
    
    So neighbourhood doughnut economics is all about thinking, how we can apply that to our homes, our streets and our neighbourhood? How we can meet the needs of all the different people living, working and playing in our neighbourhood, within the means of the little part of the planet that is our neighbourhood? And how we can do that while also respecting and looking after other people on this planet, and the planet as a whole?

    A little introduction to Doughnut Economics and how they scaled it down to a city - to give you an idea. 
    
- **And what's all this about a peer-to-peer learning journey?** ü§ù
    
    Peer-to-peer learning is a different way of learning. It's all about learning with and from each other, in whatever creative ways we choose. Everyone is the teacher. 
    
    **So what does peer-to-peer learning look like?** 
    
    We'll be a group of between 8-12 people coming together between February and May. Each week, one of us will take the lead, following [Kate Raworth‚Äôs book](https://www.kateraworth.com/) to help the whole group to learn about the basic ideas of Doughnut Economics. If that sounds scary, it shouldn't! You'll get help to prepare, and you can lead the group to learn in whatever way you feel comfortable. That might mean making something, or getting out and active, or playing a game that helps us to learn about the principle that week. At the same time, the organisations that are supporting these peer-to-peer learning journeys will be putting on loads of [talks and ‚Äúdeep dive studio days‚Äù](https://www.notion.so/Neighbourhood-Doughnut-0114ffb7fd634a248090fdcba9146750) to support our learning and connect all the learning journeys together. 
    
    **And then what?**
    
    So we've learnt together. Now we will ***do*** together! In May and July, we'll be taking what we've learnt and putting into practice in our neighbourhoods. As individuals, we'll each be exploring and experimenting with something that makes us really curious about bringing the doughnut to our doorstep. We'll still meet up regularly to share how our experiments are going. 
    
    To give you an example, I'm a filmmaker and I really like making films to reflect ideas that i‚Äôm exploring. So I'm going to experiment with how we can use filmmaking to see new/existing and better/different things for our community and our local environment.
    
- **Is it free to take part? How much time do I need to give?** ‚è∞
    
    It is free to take part. ****We'll start on the 12th and 13th February, and you'll have to be able to commit to doing a minimum of about 4-5 hours per week (up to 8 hours max) between February and July. This includes reading(or listening) and a little (supported) research, taking part in a two hour weekly peer-to-peer online/in-person session, and designing and doing your own experiments. We'll have a break over August and come back together in September to celebrate everything we've achieved.
    
    I mentioned it before, but we're one of many peer-to-peer learning journeys happening in the UK and beyond. Sometimes, we'll all be getting together in Birmingham and at the end of the learning journey we'll all be taking part in a showcase. If you're worried about travelling to Birmingham, whether it's the cost, or because you have caring responsibilities, or because you're shielding, we'll do what we can to support you still taking part. So, don't let it put you off. 
    
    So to summarise, the key dates for the peer-to-peer learning journey are: 
    
    - **Getting started weekend** | 12th & 13th February | in Birmingham. You don‚Äôt have to attend this and we‚Äôll make sure that you get to participate in some way online or at a Lewis event.
    - **Weekly peer-to-peer sessions** | Provisionally Tuesdays 6-8pm  | online/somewhere around Lewis (we‚Äôll figure out what works best for everyone taking part and possibly rejig the day and time to suit)
    - **Showcase** | 23rd & 24th July | Birmingham
    
- **Do I have to live in the Isle of Lewis?** üè†
    
    As long as you feel like you have a connection to it, and are invested in seeing all of the Hebridean islands thrive, then this peer-to-peer learning journey is for you. 
    
- **Who's supporting and funding these peer-to-peer learning journeys?** üî®
    
    All the peer-to-peer learning journeys are being supported and funded by [Civic Square](https://civicsquare.cc/), [Doughnut Economics Action Lab](https://doughnuteconomics.org/) and [Enrol Yourself](https://www.enrolyourself.com/). They've given us lots of training and resources to help host these peer-to-peer learning journeys. You can find more information [here](https://www.notion.so/Doughnut-Economics-Peer-To-Peer-Learning-Journeys-1d9a371aa51c4762b5975f77d111507e).
    

So I  invite ****you to join our new peer learning group. The way we work is changing fundamentally. But we are still applying 20thC thinking to 21stC problems. We will meet together to explore how ideas from the book [Doughnut Economics](https://doughnuteconomics.org/about-doughnut-economics) can be applied to create a better future of work.

**Economics is for everyone. Your voice matters.**¬†
If you think this group is not for you, message us anyway to find out more. Economics is for all of us because it powers so much of what happens in our lives.
Just by being yourself, you will bring a take on the world of work we haven't heard yet.

**From business as usual to transformative learning.** 
Peer learning is based on trust in the knowledge, experience and perspectives of all of the learners involved. Every student is also a teacher. It can take place in formal and informal settings, online or offline and is often self-organised.
